# Bowden-CS210-Project2

Project Summarization

This project consists of an investment program that follows the requirements of the fictional company, Airgead Banking, and it conforms with the regulations and best practices of the industry. The application was meant to be developed in order to help teach students fiscal responsibility by allowing them to see how investments grow over time. The functional requirements of the application were to display a screen with data entry prompts, to get and validate user input, and to provide a way for users to see the investment reports.

Highlight

The program aligns with the requirements very closely despite struggling with adding some of the implied features. The pictures of the desired displays that were provided by the company in the requirements are almost identical to the finished work, so pushing through to meet the requirements is something that was done particularly well.

Deficiencies

There are two small differences where the program is not identical to the company's displays that would improve the aesthetics of the program, if the dollar signs were added to users' data entries and if the dollar values were aligned by decimals. Another way the code could be improved is if upper limits on the data entries were included, which would help to ensure that the school's computers do not get hung up. A more efficient and better developed error-handling design and message box would also enhance the code and user experience.

Challenges

The validInput() function where the program gets the user input for the data entries was the most challenging to write because while changing the cursor position itself turned out to be relatively easy, validating the data with error messages was more difficult. Since reprinting the display screen after every wrong input was impractical, a message box seemed like the best choice to inform the user of errors. Due to the project's time constraints, though, a quick solution to use had to be found from a message board, and while it solved the issue, there were several problems with it: it returned a 1 to the screen, the design of the message box could not be changed, and it did not fit well with being added as a runtime error. It satisfies the project requirements, but learning more about error-handling and creating message boxes would help to make the program better.

Transferable Skills

Being able to create classes and work with objects using C++ will be the most helpful skills for other projects. Using try/catch statements for validating input will help to follow standards in the future. Being able to comply with a company's standards and to follow their requirements are also beneficial skills to have in order to preform well both professionally and academically.

Standards

The program is maintainable because its methods are focused and written clearly. It is also maintainable and readable because it includes detailed comments and follows the company and industry standards for naming conventions. It is adaptable because altering the program by adding additional features, such as printing another report using other conditions, adding more user entries, or validating new input, requires minimal code alterations due to its modularity.
